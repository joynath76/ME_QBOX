Due to the NAT.
Computer A request a web page from an Internet server. Because Computer A uses private IP addressing, the source address of the 
request has to be changed by the router because private IP addresses are not routable on the Internet. Router R1 receives the request, 
changes the source IP address to its public IP address and sends the packet to server S1. Server S1 receives the packet and replies to router R1. 
Router R1 receives the packet, changes the destination IP addresses to the private IP address of Computer A and sends the packet to Computer A.
